  "paragraph1": "My name is John Rolingson, I am {{age}} years old, I was born in Caracas 🇻🇪 and since I was a child I have lived in different parts of Spain, which has forced me to constantly **adapt to new environments**.",
  "paragraph2": "I chose to study Computer Engineering because I have always been curious about how things work, from everyday systems to the infrastructure behind modern software. At first, I was interested in pure sciences, but computer science offered me something that fit me better: the ability to create complex systems from scratch and optimise them so they work as efficiently as possible.",
  "paragraph3": "During my degree at the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid I built a **solid foundation in algorithms, data structures, systems and backend**, and I discovered a particular interest in **cybersecurity and systems architecture**. I am drawn to understanding how systems communicate, how they are protected and how their performance can be improved."
